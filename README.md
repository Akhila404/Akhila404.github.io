Using Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a virtual piano webpage. HTML structures the piano keys, CSS styles them, and JavaScript adds functionality like key press detection and sound playback. Visual Studio Code ensures efficient development and debugging. The result is an engaging platform for musical exploration.
